In a statement Monday , the Red Cross says Israel suspended the visits last year after Hamas militants took control of the Gaza Strip .
The Red Cross had been organizing the visits since 1967 .

Subsequently , the Slovaks became part of the Hungarian Kingdom , where they remained for the next 1,000 years .
Following the formation of the dual Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1867 , language and education policies favoring the use of Hungarian ( Magyarization ) resulted in a strengthening of Slovak nationalism and a cultivation of cultural ties with the closely related Czechs , who were themselves ruled by the Austrians .

Following the chaos of World War II , Czechoslovakia became a Communist nation within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe .

Zambia 's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years , with real GDP growth in 2005 - 10 about 6 % per year .
Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly increased copper mining output and profitability to spur economic growth .
Copper output has increased steadily since 2004 , due to higher copper prices and foreign investment .
In 2005 , Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative , consisting of approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief .
Poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia , despite a stronger economy .
Zambia 's dependency on copper makes it vulnerable to depressed commodity prices , but record high copper prices and a bumper maize crop in 2010 helped Zambia rebound quickly from the world economic slowdown that began in 2008 .
A high birth rate , relatively high HIV / AIDS burden , and market distorting agricultural policies have meant that Zambia 's economic growth has not dramatically decreased the stubbornly high poverty rates .

The bill is designed to improve communication and the sharing of information between the country 's 15 intelligence agencies .

Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity ( early 4th century ) .
Despite periods of autonomy , over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman , Byzantine , Arab , Persian , and Ottoman .
During World War I in the western portion of Armenia , Ottoman Turkey instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths .
The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828 ; this portion declared its independence in 1918 , but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920 .
Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh , a primarily Armenian-populated region , assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow .
Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988 ; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
By May 1994 , when a cease-fire took hold , ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of Azerbaijan proper .
The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution .
Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1994 because of the Armenian separatists ' control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas , further hampering Armenian economic growth .
In 2009 , senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with Turkey , aiming to secure an opening of the border ; this process is currently dormant .

Formerly administered as part of the British Crown Colony of Mauritius , the British Indian Ocean Territory ( BIOT ) was established as an overseas territory of the UK in 1965 .
A number of the islands of the territory were later transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976 .
Subsequently , BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups comprising the Chagos Archipelago .
The largest and most southerly of the islands , Diego Garcia , contains a joint UK-US naval support facility .
All of the remaining islands are uninhabited .
Between 1967 and 1973 , former agricultural workers , earlier residents in the islands , were relocated primarily to Mauritius , but also to the Seychelles .
Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as compensation for the displaced islanders , known as Chagossians .
Beginning in 1998 , the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits against the British Government seeking further compensation and the right to return to the territory .
In 2006 and 2007 , British court rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004 BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the archipelago , but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia .
In 2008 , the House of Lords , as the final court of appeal in the UK , ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower court rulings and finding no right of return for the Chagossians .
